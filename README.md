# KNR Drones quadcopter control
This is KNR repository for control of quadcopter drones based on ROS2 (Humble).

In order to use the repository clone it recursively.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/qbaaa-0/drone_sim
```

The simulator is implemented as an submodule, thus the `--recursive` flag.

# Prerequisities
ROS2 Humble requires Ubuntu 22.04. Make sure the correct version is installed according to [official tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).
